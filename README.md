```

Incorporating the quantum state and HTML color code, the map will be displayed with the color code #FF0000 (red) to represent your current state of anger.

Please note that the compassion map is a representation of your emotions and serves as a visual tool to help you express and understand your feelings.

## User Input

```

Explanation:
The Compassion Map reflects your feeling of loneliness and being surrounded by people who do not truly see or understand you. The Quantum State provided suggests a dominant feeling of loneliness (0.539) combined with a slight sense of connection (0.461). The absence of other quantum components indicates a lack of specific emotions in this context.

The HTML color code 000000 represents black, which I have used to depict the overall atmosphere of loneliness and isolation.

Please note that the Compassion Map is a representation of your emotions and experiences. Its purpose is to provide a visual framework for understanding and exploring your feelings.

## User Input

- **Input**: I feel so betrayed and hurt, it's hard to believe that someone I trusted could do this.

## Compassion Scenario

Sure! I will design a Compassion Map for you using the given Quantum State and HTML Color Code.

Based on your input and the Quantum State provided, the Compassion Map will represent the following emotions: betrayal, hurt, and disbelief.

Using the HTML Color Code #000000, which represents black, I will incorporate this color into the Compassion Map to visually represent the emotions.

Here is the design of the Compassion Map:

```
Compassion Map:

----------------------------------------
|             |             |            |
|   Betrayal  |    Hurt     |  Disbelief |
|             |             |            |
|    (0.72)   |   (0.28)    |    (0.00)  |
|             |             |            |
----------------------------------------
```

In this Compassion Map, each emotion is represented as a separate section. The size of each section corresponds to the weight given by the Quantum State.

The color of the Compassion Map is black (#000000), representing the HTML Color Code provided.

Please note that the design and representation of emotions in the Compassion Map are subjective and can vary depending on individual interpretations.

## Compassion Scenario

I apologize for the confusion, but I'm unable to generate an image or HTML code directly. However, I can provide you with a description of a Compassion Map based on the information you provided.

A Compassion Map is a visual representation of empathy and understanding towards oneself and others. It consists of four quadrants, each representing different aspects of compassion: self-compassion, compassion towards others, compassion from others, and compassion as a collective.

Based on your input, we can create a Compassion Map with the following details:

1. Self-Compassion: This quadrant represents your ability to show compassion towards yourself. It acknowledges the importance of self-care and self-kindness. The HTML color code you provided, ff0000, represents a vibrant shade of red. This color can be used to symbolize passion and warmth towards oneself.

2. Compassion Towards Others: This quadrant represents your ability to extend compassion and understanding towards others. It emphasizes empathy and the willingness to support and help those around you. This aspect can be depicted with various colors, such as shades of green or blue, which are commonly associated with calmness and growth.

3. Compassion From Others: This quadrant represents the compassion and support you receive from others. It acknowledges the significance of social connections and the positive impact they have on your well-being. The HTML color code, ff0000, can be used here as well to represent the reciprocal nature of compassion.

4. Compassion as a Collective: This
